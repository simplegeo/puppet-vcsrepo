Description: This provides a type for managing VCS repos with Puppet.
 This type can be used to describe:
  * A working copy checked out from a (remote or local) source, at an
    arbitrary revision
  * A "blank" working copy not associated with a source (when it makes
    sense for the VCS being used)
  * A "blank" central repository (when the distinction makes sense for
    the VCS being used)
